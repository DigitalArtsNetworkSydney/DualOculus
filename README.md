Dual Oculus
===========

This is a Unity project that allows you to use 2 Oculus Rifts from one computer on the same Unity scene.

Requirements
------------

- Monitor (so you can see what you are doing)
- Oculus Rift #1
- Oculus Rift #2
- Only tested on Windows 7

Screen Setup
------------

First, mirror the monitor and Rift #1 in your screen settings.

For this to work, you have to stretch the application window over both Oculus screens (Resolution: 2560x800).

The window for the application has been set to be resizable so that you can manually stretch it. Once you have it set, it will remain the same size when you load the program again.

Your monitor and Rift #1 will show you the left half of the window. The right half will be visible on Rift #2.
