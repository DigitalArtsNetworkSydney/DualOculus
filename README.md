Dual Oculus
===========

This is a Unity project that allows you to use 2 Oculus Rifts from one computer on the same Unity scene.

Requirements
------------

- Monitor (so you can see what you are doing)
- Oculus Rift #1
- Oculus Rift #2
- Only tested on Windows 7

Setup
-----

1. Set the Windows task bar to auto-hide.
2. Mirror the monitor and Rift #1 in your screen settings.
3. Open the project and build an .exe. 
4. Run the program and stretch the window over both Oculus screens (Resolution: 2560px x 800px).
5. The window for the program has been set to be resizable so that you can manually stretch it. Once you have it set, it will remain the same size when you load the program again.
6. Your monitor and Rift #1 will display the left half of the window. The right half will be visible on Rift #2.
7. You now have a program that allows you to use 2 Oculus Rifts from one computer on the same Unity scene.
